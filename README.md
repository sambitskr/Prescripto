# Prescripto

A user-friendly app empowering doctors to create prescriptions through a seamless interface, securely uploading them to cloud storage for patients' convenient access from anywhere, anytime.


## Description

Prescripto is an interface where doctors can use our interface to write prescriptions and upload it into cloud storage, where patients can access it anytime anywhere with an ease. Our mission is to convert the whole prescription and medical document world online.

## Why Prescripto?

* Medical information processing and software development has seen an all-around transformation in recent years. Digitalization has influenced practice management and pharmacy workflows as well.

* It has been observed that a lot of effort and time goes into managing medical records, validating prescriptions, and ensuring they are error-free.

* As medication errors can cause reputational damage, and financial loss to medical practices while increasing hospital visits and prolonged stays for patients.

* The process of generating prescriptions electronically is known as priscripto or online prescription. This electronically generated prescription is sent to a patient or pharmacist.

* This is where the Prescripto comes into the picture, as it can lessen the risks linked with patient misreading and medical errors. Priscripto softwaremaintains data confidentiality, fills panels for patients and practitioners, and helps organizations adhere to HIPAA and other industry-specific compliances.
